## **In-Memory Databases in Spring Boot**

Spring Boot makes it especially easy to use an in-memory database â€“ because it can create the configuration automatically for *H2*, *HSQLDB,* and *Derby*.

All we need to do to use a database of one of the three types in Spring Boot is add its dependency to the *pom.xml*. When the framework encounters the dependency on the classpath, it will configure the database automatically.
