## 设置Docker容器与主机时间同步

两种方法

There's a few ways to do it .

1.  You can declare the time zone directly as an environment variable in the docker compose file

>   ```
>      environment:
>         - TZ=Asia/Singapore
>         - DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
>   ```

1.  You can map the container's time zone and local time files to use that of the host machine in the docker compose file

>   ```
>   volumes:
>   - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro
>   - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
>   ```

I personally prefer to use the second method, in this way , all of my containers will have the same time configuration as my host machine
