## 解决amd 6700xt显卡驱动安装后黑屏的问题

The problem is Windows, specifically Windows update. This has been an ongoing issue for over a year now. Windows update interferes with the driver installing properly. There are many, many threads about this here in these forums.

If you want to get a successful install. Do the following:

Download the AMD driver you want to load.

Download DDU form wagnardsoft_com. It includes instructions, read and follow them.

Disable hibernation/fast startup in Windows 10.

Run DDU from Safe Mode, while disconnected from the internet.

Re-Install the driver with internet disconnected. This keeps Windows update from interfering.

See if that doesn't get you going.

BIOS里面设置PCI - E 设置为 gen3

重新插显示器。最后一步很重要。
